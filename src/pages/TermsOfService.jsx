            (MySL), a registry operated by Medication Knowledge (ABN 47 622 493

            <li className="text-base md:text-lg font-extralight leading-relaxed text-white/80 mb-2">
              <strong>Initial Registration:</strong> To use MySL, registration
              must be completed outside of OpenPharmacy, typically at a pharmacy
              or healthcare provider. A healthcare professional will verify your
              identity and initiate the registration and consent process.

              <strong>Activation Code:</strong> To link your MySL, you will need
              an Activation Code provided by a healthcare professional with
              access to your MySL account. Note that not all healthcare
              providers may be able to supply this code as some systems do not

              <strong>Data Retrieval:</strong> Once linked, OpenPharmacy
              retrieves prescription data from MySL via the OpenPharmacy API.

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">

            <li className="text-base md:text-lg font-extralight leading-relaxed text-white/80 mb-2">
              <strong>Active Prescriptions:</strong> The MySL includes only
              active prescriptions where consent was given at the time of
              prescribing. It does not provide a complete prescription history
              and will exclude prescriptions that have been withdrawn or
              revoked.

              <strong>Unlinking MySL:</strong> You can unlink your MySL account
              from OpenPharmacy. Unlinking does not delete your MySL data, and
              to delete your MySL, you must contact MySL directly.
