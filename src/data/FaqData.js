    {
      q: "How do I add prescriptions to OpenPharmacy?",
      a: "You can add prescriptions in several ways: Tap the eScript token link sent to you, which opens OpenPharmacy (ensure the app is installed). Enter the token manually in the app. Connect to My Script List (MySL) to automatically sync all active prescriptions.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I obtain an electronic prescription?",
      a: "During your next doctor’s visit, request an electronic prescription. They’ll send it to you via SMS or email with a link to your eScript token (a QR code). Tapping the link adds it to OpenPharmacy if the app is installed.",

      q: "Why doesn’t OpenPharmacy automatically update my prescription status after dispensing?",

    },
    {
      q: "Why did my prescription with repeats disappear after dispensing?",
      a: "After dispensing, the original token becomes invalid, and a new token for the next repeat is sent (typically via SMS). You need to add this new token to OpenPharmacy to see the repeat. Dispensed prescriptions are archived to keep your active list tidy. Linking to ASL automates this process.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I track paper prescriptions in OpenPharmacy?",
      a: "Yes, by registering for the Active Script List (ASL). Once linked, all prescriptions, including paper ones, sync automatically. Visit your pharmacy to set this up. If your paper prescription is a printed eScript, it may already be synced via ASL or can be added manually. Note: Initial paper prescriptions mean repeats will also be paper.",
    },

      q: "What if my prescription details are incorrect?",
      a: "Prescription data comes directly from your doctor, and OpenPharmacy cannot modify it. Contact your doctor or pharmacist to correct any errors.",

      q: "Can I view my prescriptions offline?",
      a: "You can view previously added prescriptions in OpenPharmacy without an internet connection. Adding new prescriptions requires online access.",

      q: "Can I get an ASL activation code from any pharmacy, even if it’s not my usual one?",
      a: "Yes, any pharmacy can provide your ASL activation code after verifying your identity with 100 points of ID (e.g., driver’s license, passport, Medicare card). It’s faster at a pharmacy where you’re already registered.",

      q: "Can someone else manage my prescriptions via ASL?",
